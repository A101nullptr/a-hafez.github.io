        <p class="p1"> “Two men walked into the rain forest. Moments before, the forest had been alive with the sounds
          of squawking birds and howlings monkeys. Now all was quiet as the creatuers watched the two men and wondered
          why they had come. The larger man stopped and pointed to a great Kapok tree” - The Great Kapok Tree: A Tale of
          the Amazon Rain Forest by Lynne Cherry </p class="p1">

          <h4>Skyscraper | Competition</h4>
        </a>
        <p class="p1"> Challenging the boundaries of what a skyscraper is or should be, in terms of either its form or
          function. Seeking to rethink the notion of fixed vertical structures presented as monolithic monuments,
          existing independently from there context as is often the case, into a more fluid, tactile design approach
          that is in itself, still is a narrative of intervention on the prevailing context as its predecessor, yet
          doesn't super impose its existence on it nor seeks to disconnect from it. Establishing a Symbiotic
          relationship that is codependent on its surrounding context in order to truly exist. </p class="p1">

          old Ammani house.</p class="p1">
