            existing independently from there context as is often the case, into a more fluid, tactile design approach
            that is in itself, still is a narrative of intervention on the prevailing context as its predecessor, yet
            doesn’t super impose its existence on it nor seeks to disconnect from it. Establishing a Symbiotic
            relationship that is codependent on its surrounding context in order to truly exist.

          <p class="p1">Rethinking the design and utilization of urban open spaces (UOS) in a decentralized metropolitan
            setting, through a deconstructionist approach through evaluating the efficacy of these spaces in regards to
            their temporal socio-economic narrative that is driven by a globalized discourse, while simultaneously
            recognizing the main elements of their spatial distinction. That then proposes an alternative form of UOS
            creation, incorporating tactile, modular segment designs and user-responsive technological instruments into
            the creation of a constantly temporal and changing space, encompassing elements of its urban host, while
            being automatically driven by and for its user(s).

            the streets, noting, listening, and watching with no ulterior motive rather than to observe society and the
            city. You can see how the city developed from the small details of the sidewalks or the cracked shutters of
            an old Ammani house.

            physically and morphologically based on the principles of modernity, urban living and landscape
            coordination. My idea was to differentiate between each living unit on the basis of; site's physical
            elements, potential users and morphological needs. This project consists of 22 residential units, a
            commercial complex that hosts a vegetables market, a cafe, a library and a semi-private park.

            contradicting environment on the basis of structuralism in a contemporary society. The concept was to create
            an office building that has both functions ( offices - commercial ) intersecting in a way that would allow
            for more social inclusion, accessibility and fulfillment of psychological needs.

            villa, as well as a personal recording studio for a famous lebanese singer (Firuz) assigned on top of a
            steep hill in Amman. The idea was to design a house that would suite Firuz's personality traits of; passion,
