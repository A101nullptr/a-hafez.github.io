          <p style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em;">The project is on challenging the boundaries of, what a skyscraper is or should be, in terms of either its form or function. Historically considered one the most inefficient building typologies in terms of energy consumption, largely due to its methods of air circulation as well as to the nature of its vertical circulation instruments. Here the project sought to rethink the notion of fixed vertical structures presented as monolithic monuments, existing independently from there context as is often the case, into a more fluid, tactile design approach that is in itself, still is a narrative of intervention on the prevailing context as its predecessor, yet doesn’t super impose its existence on it nor seeks to disconnect from it. Establishing a Symbiotic relationship that is codependent on its surrounding context in order to truly exist.</p>

            <p style=" padding-bottom:1em;">Adopting a multi-segmental mechansim of an elephant trunk robot system, articulating a bending  motion of the structure. While, hosting a number of internal spatial pods.</p>
            <p style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em;">Acting as a research and visitors destination of Wadi Rum. The entire structure is made of light weighted materials combined with steel cables and a mesh cover for elasticity.</p>
            <p style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em;">Presenting 3 methods of circulation with the enclosed ladder system being the main method. Extruding along the entire structure and providing access to the entire program.</p>

          <img  src="./Tactile Symbiosis/13.jpg" alt="Location">
          <p style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em;">The site measures 120 x 80 m, situated on the side of a mountain top that is 150m height at its peek. Proposed in Wadi Rum, Jordan, coined “Mars on earth” largely, due to its red sand and unusual rock formations that are reminiscent of Martian surface, inhibited by Bedouins and yearly tourists. Which in itself presents a set of challenges that the area is facing, one of which is the lack of an onsite monitoring body established for the preservation and study of this magnificent and sensitive ecological site. As well as providing an attractive destination for campers and climbers alike.</p>
          <img  src="./Tactile Symbiosis/14.jpg" alt="Elevation Shot & Side Shot">
          <p style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em;">Here the utilization of a skyscraper typology would prove beneficial, despite its short comings, it is highly efficient in combining multiple functions within a small footprint. Furthermore in regards to highlighting the notion of ecological and spatial awareness, comes the approach for allocating the structure within a pre-existing envelope such as; the side of a mountain. While, designing an active and reactive structure that physically flexes and moves in relation to different environmental and spatial stimuli, which would allow for shifting our perception of what a skyscraper is.</p>

            <img  src="./Tactile Symbiosis/6.jpg" alt="Site Plan">
            <p > While, the structure is encased within the side of a mountain, thereby creating tunnel cavities from the open elevator shaft to different building nodes, acting as cave pathways for controlling the air circulation and distribution throughtout the entire project. Allowing for warm air in the winter and cold air the Summer to be traped and redistributed. The movement is highly dependant on environmental and spatial conditions as; wind direction, daylight exposure, earthquakes and intended internal and external reorganization of the structure’s mass distribution. Capable of extending to its full length or contracting to a fraction of it.  </p>
